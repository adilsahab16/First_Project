# Visualising air pollution data

#### This project was done as part of R programming assignment for my Masters program. The ask was to create a R-Shiny app which visualises air pollution data collected across multiple sites in the Czech Republic from 2013 to 2019.

The app is available in : https://adil-sahab-16.shinyapps.io/Shinyapps_io/
